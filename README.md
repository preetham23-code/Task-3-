# Task-3-
RISC-V Project Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing the RISC-V assembly code generated from a custom application. The analysis focuses on identifying unique instructions, decoding their formats, and interpreting their functionality.

Steps Completed
Generated RISC-V Assembly:
Using riscv-objdump, the application code was disassembled to extract the RISC-V assembly instructions.

Identified Unique Instructions:
Fifteen unique RISC-V instructions were identified from the disassembled output.

Decoded 32-bit Instruction Codes:
Each instruction was analyzed to determine its exact 32-bit binary representation based on its instruction type format (e.g., R-type, I-type, S-type, etc.).

Documented Instruction Details:
For each instruction:

Mnemonic: The assembly-level representation (e.g., add, lw, beq).
Binary Encoding: The 32-bit binary code derived from its format and operands.
Instruction Type: Categorization (e.g., R-type, I-type).
Functionality: A brief explanation of what the instruction does.
Example Instruction Breakdown
Instruction: add x5, x6, x7

Binary Encoding: 0000000 00111 00110 000 00101 0110011
Instruction Type: R-type
Description: Adds the values in x6 and x7 and stores the result in x5.
Purpose:
This repository serves as a reference for understanding RISC-V instruction encoding and functionality. It showcases the process of decoding and interpreting RISC-V instructions, bridging the gap between assembly-level programming and binary encoding.
